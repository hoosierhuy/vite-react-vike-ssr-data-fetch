# React + Vite

I scaffolded this project using the Vite CLI as a client-side React project, and then I pulled in the Vike library to enable server-side rendering, including data fetching. The objective is to demonstrate how to switch from a client-side Vite React app to a server-side render Vite React app, using the Vike library, formerly know as vite-plugin-ssr.
